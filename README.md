# UFOs
Visualization with Java Script
### Challenge

In this assignment we created a web-page with an interactive table with UFO data. 
For this task we used the following tools and languages:
- HTML and CSS to create and stye a web page
- JavaScript to make the page interactive and fill it in with the data
- VS Code as an development environment
- data.js file as a data source

The goal for this task was to create a dinamic table with advanced filtering capability that allows users to filter the data by multiple factors. To succeed in this we used functions, if-else statements and forEach loops. In addition, we used D3.js - JavaScript libraries which helped us with elements manipulation and event listeners.
